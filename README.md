Spykee perl interface
=====================

The Spykee is a robot produced by Meccano with belts, camera, speakers
and microfonoe running Linux.  The source for the firmware was
published around Mai 2010.  The firmware listen on TCP ports 9000 and
9001, and allow the robot to be controled using a simple package based
protocol via TCP.

This perl module allow one to connect to the robot via TCP and control
the robot using perl.  The license is GPL v2 or later.
